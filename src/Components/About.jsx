             After two and a half years of experience with UX design and research I decided to extend my knowledge and focus on frontend development with React.

With previous IT experience during internship at PwC and at the university on certain courses, I am looking forward to start with frontend development in practice.

I am currently on maternity leave and open to discussion about entry-level job with time flexibility.
